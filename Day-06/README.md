## 📌 What I Learned

### 1️⃣ Connecting MongoDB Atlas
- Learned how to create and use a MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Used the connection string to link the cloud database with backend
- Understood how a backend connects to an online database

---

### 2️⃣ Using Mongoose for Database Connection
- Learned how to use **mongoose.connect()** to connect database with server
- Created a separate function to handle database connection
- Understood the role of Mongoose as a bridge between server and database

---

### 3️⃣ Connecting Server with Database
- Connected Express server with MongoDB database
- Ensured database connection happens before handling requests
- Verified connection using console messages
