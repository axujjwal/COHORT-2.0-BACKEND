# Backend Learning – Day 07 🚀

This repository contains my **Day 07 backend learning work**, where I structured my backend properly and connected my Notes application with **MongoDB using Mongoose models and environment variables**.

---

## 📌 What I Learned

### 1️⃣ Database Configuration
- Created a separate database configuration file
- Used a function to handle MongoDB connection
- Learned how to connect backend with database using Mongoose

---

### 2️⃣ Environment Variables (.env)
- Stored MongoDB connection string in `.env` file
- Learned why sensitive data should not be hardcoded
- Used `process.env` to access database URL securely

---

### 3️⃣ Mongoose Model (Schema)
- Created a schema for Notes using Mongoose
- Defined fields like title, description, and age
- Understood how models represent collections in MongoDB

---

### 4️⃣ Notes API with Database
- Created API to store notes in MongoDB
- Fetched notes from database using model
- Learned how server, model, and database work together

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack Used
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- MongoDB Atlas  
- Mongoose  
- JavaScript  
- dotenv  

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Practice
The goal of this project was **not complexity**, but:
- Learning proper backend structure
- Understanding models and database connection
- Practicing API with MongoDB
- Writing cleaner and organized backend code

---

## 📈 Learning Approach
I am documenting my learning step by step and focusing on:
- Clarity over shortcuts  
- Concepts over memorization  
- Consistent daily progress
