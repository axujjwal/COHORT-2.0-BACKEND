# Backend Learning – Day 03 🚀

This repository contains my **Day 03 backend learning work**, where I focused on understanding **APIs**, **REST APIs**, and building a **mini project using REST principles**.

---

## 📌 What I Learned

### 1️⃣ Understanding APIs
- Learned what an API (Application Programming Interface) is
- Understood how APIs enable communication between client and server
- Explored the request → response flow in backend systems

---

### 2️⃣ What is a REST API
- Learned the concept of REST (Representational State Transfer)
- Understood how REST APIs are structured
- Worked specifically with HTTP methods:
  - GET
  - POST
- Learned when and why these methods are used

---

### 3️⃣ Mini Project with REST API
- Built a small backend project following REST principles
- Created API endpoints using **GET** and **POST**
- Practiced sending requests and receiving responses
- Focused on clarity and correct API behavior

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- JavaScript
- REST APIs

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Practice
The goal of this project was **not complexity**, but:
- Understanding how APIs work
- Learning REST API fundamentals
- Practicing GET and POST methods
- Strengthening backend basics

---

## 📈 Learning Approach
I am documenting my learning step by step and focusing on:
- Clarity over shortcuts
- Concepts over memorization
- Consistency over speed
