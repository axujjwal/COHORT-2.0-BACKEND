# Frontend Learning – Mouse Follower & Performance 🚀

This repository contains my learning work where I built a **mouse follower animation** using JavaScript and CSS and explored the **browser Performance DevTools** to understand FPS and frames.

---

## 📌 What I Learned

### 1️⃣ Mouse Interaction with JavaScript
- Used the `mousemove` event to track cursor position
- Learned about `clientX` and `clientY`
- Updated element position dynamically based on mouse movement

---

### 2️⃣ Smooth Animation with requestAnimationFrame
- Used `requestAnimationFrame()` for smooth animation
- Understood how it improves performance compared to normal loops
- Learned how animations run frame by frame in the browser

---

### 3️⃣ Styling for Animated Elements
- Used CSS properties like:
  - `position: absolute`
  - `border-radius`
  - `transform: translate()`
- Created a circular element that follows the mouse pointer

---

### 4️⃣ Browser DevTools (Performance Tab)
- Explored the Performance DevTool in the browser
- Observed FPS (Frames Per Second)
- Learned how frames are rendered during animations
- Understood how performance can be measured for UI effects

## 🛠 Tech Stack Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Browser DevTools  

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Practice
The goal of this project was:
- To understand how user interaction works in the browser
- To practice animation using JavaScript
- To learn how to analyze performance using DevTools
- To improve frontend fundamentals

---

## 📈 Learning Approach
I am documenting my learning step by step and focusing on:
- Concept clarity before complexity  
- Practice through small experiments  
- Consistent daily progress
